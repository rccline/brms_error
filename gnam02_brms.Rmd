## Libraries
```{r}

### Sample data structure
```{r}
weight_df2 <- read_csv(here("weight_structure.csv"))
```
 

### Filter df2  
```{r}
weight_male_df <- weight_df2 %>% 
  filter(gender == 'male')

```



### Run brms::brm function.  BRM calls C++ which throws error.  
```{r}

Mb <- brms::brm(weight ~ height, data=weight_male_df)

```

### Errors:

This problem is probably due to using incompatible versions of the cygwin DLL.
Search for cygwin1.dll using the Windows Start->Find/Search facility
and delete all but the most recent version.  The most recent version *should*
reside in x:\cygwin\bin, where 'x' is the drive on which you have
installed the cygwin distribution.  Rebooting is also suggested if you
are unable to find another cygwin DLL.

### Troubleshooting:
I used emacs, which makes it pretty easy to get to the document. The Stan getting started page also has instructions for modifying Makevars.win. One last point: the original poster had the directory RbuildTools in C; I did not. Instead I had Rtools. I created .Rprofile in my home directory with the below to fix that  

### Sys.setenv(BINPREF = "C:/Rtools/mingw_$(WIN)/bin/")  Did not work

weight_df <- read_csv("data/weight.csv")
weight_male_df <- weight_df %>% 
  filter(gender == 'male')



M <- lm(weight ~ height, data= weight_male_df)
M

### con <- file(system.file("C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.0\"), open = "r")
### dyn.load("brms")
Mb <- brm(weight ~ height, data=weight_male_df)

###   Putting Rtools on the PATH
### After installation is complete, you need to perform one more step to be able to compile R packages: 
  # you need to put the location of the Rtools make utilities (bash, make, etc) on the PATH.
  # The easiest way to do so is create a text file .Renviron in your Documents folder which contains the following line:
<!-- #   PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\usr\bin;${PATH}" -->
<!-- # You can do this with a text editor, or you can even do it from R like so: -->
<!-- #   writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron") -->
<!-- # Now restart R, and verify that make can be found, which should show the path to your Rtools installation. -->
<!-- # Sys.which("make") -->
<!-- # ## "C:\\rtools40\\usr\\bin\\make.exe" -->
<!-- # If this works, you can try to install an R package from source: -->
<!-- #   install.packages("jsonlite", type = "source") -->
<!-- # If this succeeds, youâ€™re good to go! See the links below to learn more about rtools40 and the Windows build infrastructure. -->
